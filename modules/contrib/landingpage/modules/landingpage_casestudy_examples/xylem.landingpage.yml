Additonally, images from the slider had to be zoomable on mobile devices, \n      and the slider had to play videos with the multilanguage subtitles. As a solution we have developed a custom slider to fulfil all the requirements and device support. \n      We used JW Player for displaying videos with multilanguage subtitles within the custom modal slider and PinchZoom.js for the mobile zooming.</p>\n\n      <p>The functional layouts were deployed to the marketing platform Marketo that the client uses for evaluation and analysis of the digital data and contact form entries. \n      That was our first experience working with Marketo and we were happy to get the new technology skill to support the client along the en re development cycle.</p>", format: full_html }
